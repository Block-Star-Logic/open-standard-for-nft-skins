This is the repository for the open standard for NFT skins 

Skinnable NFTs are NFTs that can be masked by other NFTs so as to confer additional attriabutes to the Skinnable. This confers several advantages to the Skinnable NFT in
that it can retain it's core functions within a dApp whilst obtaining the additional functions from the NFT that it is using as a Skin. 
The basic implementation is to use a non-skinnable NFT to apply as a Skin to a Skinnable NFT. The result is that the Skinnable NFT will show the metadata of the non-skinnable NFT when the 'getTokenURI()' function is called. 
Usecases for this include rental of premium NFTs as Skins for functional NFTs e.g. building access pass NFTs.
